## Definitions

#### Abstraction

> Abtraction is all about how we design our class and the main goal really out of abstraction is to just design our code in a way where the end user has a simple interface that's easy to use and that's all they have to worry about. All the internal workings and complicated parts of a class are tucked inside the class and the user doesn't have to worry about understanding them. Similar to a coffee maker. You know how to use it and make use of the simplicity it provides without needing to worry about what goes on inside to make your coffee.

#### Attributes / Properties

> Attributes and properties are basically the same thing. These are considered to be the data members in a class that make it unique and separate from other classes. For example, some attributes or properties of a person would be their name, age, and height. Speaking and eating can be considered behaviors or methods of the class.

#### Class

> A class is really just a "blue print" for creating objects. For example, I have a class car that represents a car and the objects of that class are numerous types of cars.
