#### Abstraction

> Abtraction is all about how we design our class and the main goal really out of abstraction is to just design our code in a way where the end user has a simple interface that's easy to use and that's all they have to worry about. All the internal workings and complicated parts of a class are tucked inside the class and the user doesn't have to worry about understanding them. Similar to a coffee maker. You know how to use it and make use of the simplicity it provides without needing to worry about what goes on inside to make your coffee
