## P03A - Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
### Yoseph Helal
### Description: 

A Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock program that creates random characters for different hands from all 5 objects and pits them against each other. It decides on a winner and if both hands happen to have the same character, it randomizes again until they're both different.
